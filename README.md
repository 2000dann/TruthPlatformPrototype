Project Overview
TruthPlatformPrototype is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and retrieve posts. The platform leverages smart contracts written in Solidity and a frontend powered by React and Web3.js for seamless interaction with the Ethereum network. This prototype demonstrates the basic functionality of posting content in a censorship-resistant and immutable manner.
