****TruthPlatformPrototype****

**Project Overview**

"Truth Platform" is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and retrieve posts. The platform leverages smart contracts written in Solidity and a frontend powered by React and Web3.js for seamless interaction with the Ethereum network. It is still in it's very early version, and this is just a "blue-print"/prototype version of what could be created. Thus far, this project demonstrates the basic functionality of posting content in a censorship-resistant and immutable manner.

**Features**
**Create Posts**: Users can create posts that are stored permanently on the blockchain.

**Retrieve Posts**: All posts can be retrieved, ensuring transparency and traceability.

**Decentralized**: Operates on the Ethereum blockchain, making it censorship-resistant.

**Frontend**: A simple React-based UI that interacts with the blockchain via Web3.js.

****Project Structure****

The project is divided into several key components:

**Contracts**: Contains Solidity smart contracts (TruthPlatform.sol) that govern the platformâ€™s behavior.

**Frontend**: A React application that serves as the user interface, interacting with the smart contracts via Web3.js.

**Migrations**: Includes scripts for deploying the smart contracts to a local or public Ethereum network using Truffle.

**Tests**: Contains unit tests to ensure proper contract behavior.

**GOALS**

**1 Immutable Posts**: All posts created on the platform are stored on the blockchain and cannot be deleted or altered.

**2 Decentralization**: The platform runs on a decentralized Ethereum network to avoid centralized control or censorship.

**3 Smart Contract Integration**: Efficient and secure use of smart contracts to manage content creation and retrieval.
