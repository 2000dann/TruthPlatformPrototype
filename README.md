****TruthPlatformPrototype****

**Project Overview**

"Truth Platform" is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and retrieve posts. The platform leverages smart contracts written in Solidity and a frontend powered by React and Web3.js for seamless interaction with the Ethereum network. It is still in it's very early version, and this is just a "blue-print"/prototype version of what could be created. Thus far, this project demonstrates the basic functionality of posting content in a censorship-resistant and immutable manner.

**Features**
**Create Posts**: Users can create posts that are stored permanently on the blockchain.
**Retrieve Posts**: All posts can be retrieved, ensuring transparency and traceability
**Decentralized**: Operates on the Ethereum blockchain, making it censorship-resistant.
**Frontend**: A simple React-based UI that interacts with the blockchain via Web3.js.
